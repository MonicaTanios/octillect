**Firebase Cloud Firestore** is a powerful, flexible, scalable No-SQL cloud database tool Presented by Google.
We Used Cloud Firestore as our database back-end. We tried to find a way to separate Firebase API methods from Business Logic but we didn't find something promising so we built our own API Classes to do so.
We also Built Repository Design Pattern to abstract the data layer and centralize the data access objects passing and retrieval.
