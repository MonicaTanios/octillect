We've built a **powerful Filtering tool**, by which the user can filter board's tasks by name, assignee or Tag.
Which is Helpful in quickly finding a specific task or a whole type of tasks.

It was a Challenge to build this tool, as the data we make query about is not collected in one place, like a GridView for example, but it's separated in draggable columns.
