**Material** is an adaptable system of guidelines, components, and tools _that Google developed_, which supports **the best practices of user interface design**, and from which we inspired a lot and used as a reference in UI Design.

These guidelines describe the look, interactions, and customization possibilities for UIs that use Material — including how to apply color, typography, shape, and layout. They also show how each component is structured: its usage, types, anatomy, placement, behavior, and customization.
We just can't imagine building a software application without inspiring from Material Design.
