We've always wanted the combination of GitHub Commits timeline and a task manager from which the user can assign tasks to team members, mark tasks as done and update project's tasks list after showing in the commits timeline.

**Octillect** has made this beautiful combination, by using **GitHub API**, So you just write your Repository's name and download your OAuth Token from GitHub Accountâ€”_Your Token is safe at your local machine, we don't have any version of it in our database._
