We Used **Git** as our _Version control system_, it's really a powerful tool, it released from us the load of collecting our code, know the changes made to files, and made the last version of code in all the team's hands all the time.
**GitHub flow** is the workflow which we used, it's a lightweight, branch-based workflow, It supports teams and projects where deployments are made regularly, and it was really fun and it facilitated a lot of work through the whole project.
