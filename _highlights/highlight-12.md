title: "Branding: The Octopus Identity"

- We've developed a full brand identity built on an **_Octopus_** (referring to multitasking) & **_Space_**, having its own logo, colors, theme, etc.
- We use a [**Style Guide**](https://github.com/MichelineMedhat/octillect/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) to make sure that code remains clean and we are following the same guidelines while doing any other thing — _committing & UI design_ — not just coding.
- Most of the code is branded with the prefix `O` or `OCT` (e.g. `OButton`, `OCTException`).
